title: NeuronBridge
tagline: A web application for easily and rapidly finding putative morphological matches between large data sets of neurons imaged using different modalities, namely electron microscopy (EM) and light microscopy (LM). Matches have been precomputed for all of Janelia's public EM/LM data sets, and are quick to look up by identifier. You can also upload your own data and match it against these public data sets.
