        Open-source code and software are immensely important to progress in all
        areas of science. Sharing code allows the same analyses to be performed
        across labs, facilitates wide-spread use of computational tools that are
        increasingly important in biology, and enables for different groups to
        build on top of others’ achievements. Additionally, the transparency
        that open-source code provides creates trust in results produced by
        scientific software.
        <br /><br />
        The challenge at Janelia is not to convince researchers that they should
        share their code but to help them do this as efficiently and productively
        as possible. Importantly, sharing code successfully requires more than just
        releasing it as-is under an open license. Only well-designed and well- documented
        code is easy to reuse or modify for new applications by other developers
        (developer-friendly), which usually constitutes significant efforts. Similarly
        hard is the design of intuitive user interfaces that allow scientists without
        expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms to use the software (user-friendly).
        Additionally, sustained long-term effort is often required to support such
        code and software over its lifetime -- providing user support, fixing bugs,
        and maintaining the code. These efforts are not yet reliably recognized as
        part of scientists’ career-related work, particularly outside of Janelia,
        although they can easily take the majority of time spent on any project involving
        software. This forces many scientists to carefully balance between creating
        widely useful code/software and moving on to the next project. Therefore,

      <Fragment slot="content">
        In regular intervals we are inviting proposals for Open-Source Software
        projects from scientists at Janelia. The aim of a proposal should
        generally be to develop, maintain and/or document developer-friendly,
        user-friendly code that promises to have a significant impact on the
        community.

        The creation of OSSI was encouraged by the strong open science community
        at Janelia. The specifics were finalized by Kristin Branson, Reed
        George, Wyatt Korff, Stephan Preibisch, Konrad Rokicki, Stephan
        Saalfeld, and Ron Vale. OSSI is funded through the Technology and Open
        Science Center fund (SciComp internal funding) with strong support from
        Wyatt Korff (project teams), Reed George (Scientific Operations), the
        Saalfeld lab, and the executive director of Janelia (Ron Vale).
