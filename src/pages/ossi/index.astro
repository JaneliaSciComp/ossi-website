      <Fragment slot="content">
        Open-source code and software are immensely important to progress in all
        areas of science. Sharing code allows the same analyses to be performed
        across labs, facilitates wide-spread use of computational tools that are
        increasingly important in biology, and enables for different groups to
        build on top of others’ achievements. Additionally, the transparency
        that open-source code provides creates trust in results produced by
        scientific software.
        <br /><br />
        The challenge at Janelia is not to convince researchers that they should
        share their code but to help them do this as efficiently and productively
        as possible. Importantly, sharing code successfully requires more than just
        releasing it as-is under an open license. Only well-designed and well-documented
        code is easy to reuse or modify for new applications by other developers
        (developer-friendly), which usually constitutes significant efforts. Similarly
        hard is the design of intuitive user interfaces that allow scientists without
        expert knowledge of the underlying algorithms to use the software (user-friendly).
        Additionally, sustained long-term effort is often required to support such
        code and software over its lifetime — providing user support, fixing bugs,
        and maintaining the code. These efforts are not yet reliably recognized as
        part of scientists’ career-related work, particularly outside of Janelia,
        although they can easily take the majority of time spent on any project involving
        software. This forces many scientists to carefully balance between creating
        widely useful code/software and moving on to the next project. Therefore,

        We invite proposals for Open-Source Software projects from scientists at
        Janelia. The aim of a proposal should generally be to develop, maintain
        and/or document developer-friendly, user-friendly code that promises to
        have a significant impact on the community.

      <Fragment slot="content">
        OSSI project proposals enter in a <b>Proposed</b> state and after being evaluated
        are either moved to <b>Accepted</b> state or rejected (see diagram below).
        Proposals for otherwise great projects may be rejected due of lack of funding,
        or because they don't meet criteria for being considered ideal open science
        projects. In such cases, Scientific Computing Software can still help develop
        the project if alternative funding is identified. After moving to the <b
          >Accepted</b
        > state, Scientific Computing Software will attempt to find software developers
        to work on the project, either from within the department, or by hiring contractors.
        Once developers are identified, the project will move to
        <b>Active Development</b>. During this phase, the goals of the project
        proposal will be iterated until completion. Once the proposal goals are
        achieved, the project will move to <b>Maintenance</b> state, which provides
        minimal ongoing support for the project such as critical bug fixes and dependency
        updates. A project may be moved back to
        <b>Active Development</b> if additional features are needed and funding is
        available. If a project's usefulness to the open science community declines,
        it may be moved to a <b>Graceful End</b> state which signifies a closing
        of OSSI involvement with the project. This may involve a hand-off or project
        archival. All of these lifecycle decisions are made in close collaboration
        with the project owners.
